# Machine Learning Projects
All the Data Science / Machine Learning Projects are included in this repository.

#Description: 
The Machine learning projects covers all the areas of the Machine Learning ranging from Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning to the state of the art Deep Neural Network technologies.
This Readme serves mainly as the "Table of Contents", with "Prerequisites" and "Getting Started Guides" for each of the respective projects added to each project specific sub directories.

## Getting Started Guide:
The Pre-requisite and the usage guide are project specific and hence included in the project specific README files in their respective directories.

Please traverse into the specific project you want to try and follow the project specific "Getting Started Guide"


## Table of Contents
The table of contents represents the structure of the directory and sub directory of various machine learning projects, as in this repository. 

We have tried to structure the various projects into the proper structure and category, based on their respective machine learning project tasks. Please visit the directory, for details regarding the projects and the "Getting Started Guide"
